### Real-time IoT Sensor Data Dashboard

<img src="https://github.com/semihdesticioglu/Streaming_Sensor_Data_Realtime_Dashboard/blob/f1990afe1731b2495b0891c28c38f2b0705f9895/images/streaming_sensor_data.jpg" width="500"  height="300"/>

This project aims to visualize sensor data in real-time by utilizing Spark Streaming, Kafka, and Kibana. The dataset contains data from 255 sensors in 51 rooms across 4 floors of the Sutardja Dai Hall at UC Berkeley. The data includes CO2 concentration, humidity, temperature, light, and PIR motion sensor readings. 
The project involves 
* preprocessing the dataset with PySpark, 
* producing it into a Kafka topic, 
* consuming the topic with Spark Streaming, 
* and finally visualizing the data with Kibana on ElasticSearch.

### Turkcell AI Vision Challenge Contest / Deep Learning Project

Turkcell AI Vision Challenge competition was held in my company internally and I won the prize with my winning project. Out of 120 project, it is awarded as 1st. 
I created a CNN deep learning algorithm using Pytorch library and pre-trained Resnet-18 model with transfer learning approach.

### Airbnb Istanbul Data Analysis 

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*9N7PTJYYvUEqIQZnDJh4LQ.jpeg" width="500"  height="300"/>

I analyzed Airbnb Istanbul data and answer some questions about the data. The project‚Äôs scope is exploratory data analysis with visuals and maps, applying a statistical test to data to answer the questions correctly.

All analyses are can be found on Medium Post : [https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/airbnb-istanbul-data-analysis-b510c98a37e4](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/airbnb-istanbul-data-analysis-b510c98a37e4)

### Amazon & MediaMarkt Smartphone Prices Web Scraping Project

This project aims to get smartphone and other devices' current prices from Amazon and MediaMarkt websites by web scraping.
Selenium, BeatifulSoup and Request libaries are used for scraping.
Scraping algorithm collects product models, brands, old and new prices from Amazon & MediaMarkt websites and build Pandas dataframes with these collections.

I was nominated to CXO prize with this RPA tool. It is used for monitoring the competitor prices in Turkcell. Tool was sending daily auto-emails with scraped price lists.

### Disaster Response Project - Multioutput NLP Classifier

This project aims building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to categorize messages for possible disaster events that could happen in future.

In this project, I have built a Multioutput Classification model to predict message categories in future possible disasters.There are 36 pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include Aid Related, Medical Help,Food, Death etc. By classifying these messages, we can help government or other aid organizations about prioritizing critical messases in possible disaster events.
